# VacciBucks

Makes robots very sad about their financial decisions. Works in MvM, uses some weird upgrade mechanics to print money.

## Changelog

- v1.2 Initial Release 11/13/24

## How to not mess this up
1. Equip Vaccinator (important!!!)
2. Stand in upgrade station
3. Watch money go brrr
4. Press K if something breaks

## How to definitely mess this up
- Moving away while it's running
- Dying while it's running
- Spamming the script
- Using any other medigun (seriously, vaccinator only)

## Notes
- Sometimes takes a few seconds to start.
- If you didn't get money, just try again. (usually its fine but it may behave weirdly)
- If you die during sequence, just go back to upgrade station. (Yes, this can happen.)
- Don't blame me if you get kicked (you won't but y'know...)
- Works best when you're not being shot at by 47 robots
- This only works in wave 1, and you must have at least 600 credits to start with.

## Credits
- whoever found this glitch first lol
- me for making it automatic
- robots for being bad at math

## Requirements
- Lmaobox
- Working brain (optional)
- Vaccinator (not optional)
